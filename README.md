# TailTracker
TailTracker is a web application that tracks all of your dogs activities, so that you can track their exercise needs more affectively. 
 
## Motivation
I created TailTracker so users could accurately assess how exercise helps their dogs and tracks if the dogs are getting enough exercise.
